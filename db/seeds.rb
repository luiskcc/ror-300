  'Core Concepts' => [
    {
      question: "What was the initial release date of Ruby on Rails?",
      answer: "Ruby on Rails was first released as an open-source framework in July 2004."
    },
    {
      question: "Who created Ruby on Rails?",
      answer: "David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) created Ruby on Rails."
    },
    {
      question: "What programming language is Rails built on?",
      answer: "Rails is built on the Ruby programming language."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the two core principles of the Rails Doctrine?",

    },
    {
      question: "Explain 'Convention over Configuration' (CoC).",
      answer: "CoC means Rails provides sensible defaults and patterns, reducing the need for explicit configuration from the developer. For example, a model named `User` automatically maps to a database table named `users`."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain 'Don't Repeat Yourself' (DRY).",
      answer: "DRY is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of code and logic. In Rails, this is achieved through features like partials, helpers, and concerns."
    },
    {
      question: "What was the 'Basecamp' application and what is its relation to Rails?",
      answer: "Basecamp is a project management tool from which Ruby on Rails was extracted by DHH as an open-source framework."
    },
    {
      question: "How did Rails influence modern web development?",
      answer: "Rails popularized the MVC pattern, CoC, and a focus on developer productivity, influencing many other web frameworks."
    },
    {
      question: "What are some famous applications built with Rails?",
      answer: "Famous applications built with Rails include GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, and Basecamp."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the basic directory structure of a new Rails application?",
      answer: "Key directories include `app`, `bin`, `config`, `db`, `lib`, `public`, and `test`."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of the `app` directory?",
      answer: "The `app` directory contains the core application logic, including models, views, controllers, and helpers."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of the `db` directory?",
      answer: "The `db` directory holds the database schema, migrations, and seed data."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the purpose of the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.",
      answer: "The `Gemfile` lists the applicationâ€™s gem dependencies, while `Gemfile.lock` records the exact versions of the gems that were installed, ensuring consistent environments."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the request/response cycle in a Rails application.",
      answer: "An HTTP request is received by the Rails router, which maps it to a controller action. The action interacts with models, then renders a view, which is sent back as an HTTP response."
    },
    {
      question: "What are Rails environments and how are they configured?",
      answer: "Rails has `development`, `test`, and `production` environments, each with its own specific configuration file in the `config/environments` directory."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a Model in the context of Rails MVC?",
      answer: "A Model represents the data and business logic of the application, typically implemented as an Active Record class that interacts with the database."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Active Record?",
      answer: "Active Record is Rails' Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that connects models to database tables, simplifying database interactions."
    },
    {
      question: "What is an Active Record migration?",
      answer: "An Active Record migration is a script used to alter the database schema in a structured and version-controlled manner."
    },
    {
      question: "What are validations in Active Record? Give an example.",
      answer: "Validations ensure that only valid data is saved to the database. An example is `validates :name, presence: true` to ensure a name field is not empty."
    },
    {
      question: "What are callbacks in Active Record? Name three.",
      answer: "Callbacks are hooks into the lifecycle of an Active Record object that allow code to be executed at specific moments. Examples include `before_save`, `after_create`, and `after_destroy`."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the `has_many` and `belongs_to` associations.",
      answer: "`has_many` indicates a one-to-many relationship where one record has many associated records. `belongs_to` signifies the inverse, where a record belongs to another single record."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the N+1 query problem?",
      answer: "The N+1 query problem occurs when fetching a parent record and then, in a loop, executing a separate query for each of its associated child records, leading to many unnecessary database queries."
    },
    {
      question: "How can you solve an N+1 query problem using `includes`?",
      answer: "The `includes` method eager loads associated records, fetching them in a single or minimal number of queries to avoid the N+1 problem. For example, `User.includes(:posts)`."
    },
    {
      question: "What are scopes in Active Record?",
      answer: "Scopes are custom class methods defined in models to encapsulate and reuse common queries. An example is `scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }`."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between `find`, `find_by`, and `where`?",
      answer: "`find` retrieves a single record by its primary key. `find_by` returns the first record that matches a given condition. `where` returns a collection of records that satisfy a specified condition."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of `pluck` in Active Record?",
      answer: "`pluck` retrieves specific column(s) directly from the database without instantiating full Active Record objects, useful for performance when only specific data is needed."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a Controller in the context of Rails MVC?",
      answer: "A Controller in Rails is responsible for handling incoming web requests, processing input, interacting with Models, and preparing data for the View layer."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a View in the context of Rails MVC?",
      answer: "A View in Rails is responsible for presenting data to the user, typically as HTML generated from ERB templates that use data provided by the Controller."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you define a basic route in Rails?",
      answer: "Routes are defined in `config/routes.rb`. A basic route can be defined using `get '/path', to: 'controller#action'`."
    },
    {
      question: "What are RESTful routes in Rails?",
      answer: "RESTful routes map HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) to controller actions, providing a standardized way to interact with resources (e.g., `resources :users` creates routes for `index`, `show`, `new`, `create`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy` actions)."
